pls bug fix this


Currently working on this platformer in python using the arcade library.

NOTE: At first I was using pygame and that code is separated from the arcade code, I might return to it some day (unlikely). The pygame code should still work if you want to take a look at it. However, the arcade version of the project has many more features added.
